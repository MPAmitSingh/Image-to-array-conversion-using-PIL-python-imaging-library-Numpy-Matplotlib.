Project-5 : Image to array conversion using PIL(python imaging library), Numpy, Matplotlib.

🚀 Excited to share my latest project using the Python Image Library (PIL). 
I recently completed a project where I explored the powerful capabilities of PIL Library, focusing on:-
🖼️ Converting images to arrays: Unlocking the potential to manipulate and analyze images as numerical data.
Visualizing images in different colors: Experimenting with various color spaces to enhance image understanding and creativity.
This journey has been a fantastic learning experience, diving deeper into image processing and data visualization.
